All the files in this folder implement test cases that validate some component
of the Berkeley DB system.

They are driven by script files, that are shell script based. They are not
generally designed to be run outside of the shell.

There is a "driver" script called s_validate in the dist directory of the
repository that can be used to run all the scripts in this directory.

Any new script will be automatically run by the s_validate driver.
