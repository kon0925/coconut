     * Joined values are retrieved by doing a sequential iteration over the
     * first cursor in the cursor array, and a nested iteration over each
     * following cursor in the order they are specified in the array. This
     * requires database traversals to search for the current datum in all the

     * normally results from sorting the cursors from the one that refers to
     * the least number of data items to the one that refers to the most.
     * Unless this method is called with true, {@link SDatabase#join} does this
     * sort on behalf of its caller.
     * <p>
     * If the data are structured so that cursors with many data items also
     * share many common elements, higher performance will result from listing
     * those cursors before cursors with fewer data items; that is, a sort
     * order other than the default. Calling this method permits applications
     * to perform join optimization prior to calling {@link SDatabase#join}.
