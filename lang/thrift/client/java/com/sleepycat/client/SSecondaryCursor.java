/**
 * A database cursor for a secondary database.
 * <p>
 * Secondary cursors are returned by {@link SSecondaryDatabase#openCursor}. The
 * distinguishing characteristics of a secondary cursor are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Direct calls to {@code put()} methods on a secondary cursor are
 * prohibited.</li>
 * <li>The {@link SCursor#delete} method of a secondary cursor will delete the
 * primary record and as well as all its associated secondary records.</li>
 * <li>Calls to all get methods will return the data from the associated
 * primary database.</li>
 * <li>Additional get method signatures are provided to return the primary key
 * in an additional {@code pKey} parameter.</li>
 * <li>Calls to {@link #dup} will return a {@link SSecondaryCursor}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * To obtain a secondary cursor with default attributes:
 * <pre>
 *  SSecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, null);
 * </pre>
 * To customize the attributes of a cursor, use a {@link SCursorConfig} object.
 * <pre>
 *  SCursorConfig config = new SCursorConfig();
 *  config.setDirtyRead(true);
 *  SSecondaryCursor cursor = myDb.openSecondaryCursor(txn, config);
 * </pre>
