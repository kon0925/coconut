/**
 * A database cursor. Cursors are used for operating on collections of records,
 * for iterating over a database, and for saving handles to individual records,
 * so that they can be modified after they have been read.
 * <p>
 * If the cursor is to be used to perform operations on behalf of a
 * transaction, the cursor must be opened and closed within the context of that
 * single transaction.
 * <p>
 * If you do not close the cursor before closing the database handle or the
 * transaction handle that owns this cursor, then, closing a database handle or
 * a transaction handle closes these open cursors. Once the cursor close method
 * has been called, the handle may not be accessed again, regardless of the
 * close method's success or failure.
 * <p>
 * To obtain a cursor with default attributes:
 * <pre>
 *  SCursor cursor = myDatabase.openCursor(txn, null);
 * </pre>
 * To customize the attributes of a cursor, use a {@link SCursorConfig} object.
 * <pre>
 *  SCursorConfig config = new SCursorConfig();
 *  config.setDirtyRead(true);
 *  SCursor cursor = myDatabase.openCursor(txn, config);
 * </pre>
 * Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected in
 * the scan; that is, records inserted behind a cursor will not be returned
 * while records inserted in front of a cursor will be returned. In Queue and
 * Recno databases, missing entries (that is, entries that were never
 * explicitly created or that were created and then deleted) will be ignored
 * during a sequential scan.
