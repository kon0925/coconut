This example shows how Oracle Berkeley DB can be used to implement an 
automobile after-sale management application. This application provides a
communication interface via the command line. There are three main entrance 
points for the application: administrator, customer and engineer. The user 
enters the system by specifing different flags such as -a, -c, -e for 
administrator, customer and engineer respectively and then logs in to carry 
out further operations.
  
Administrator login: manage the customer information and engineer information,
handle service requested by customer or submitted by engineer. An 
administrator password is already set up (use "admin").

Customer login: edit customer information or request service.
Log in with the customer's name, which can be found in the second
column of the customer.txt file (for example, ZhangSan).

Engineer login: edit engineer information or request additional
service after the maintenance. Log in with the engineer's name,
which can be found in the second column of the engineer.txt file
(for example, LiQiang).

The application will use three input files: customer.txt, engineer.txt, 
service.txt. These files are in the ./ServicemgmtExample directory and 
an example of the format is shown below:
001#ZhangSan#12345678#zhongshanroad#zhangsan@gmail.com#87654321#Lavida#2014-05-01 

BUILD and RUN

Windows

To build this example, build the ex_servicemgmt project in Berkeley_DB solution 
with Visual Studio platform.

To run the example, execute file RunServicemgmtExample.bat in 
examples/c/ex_servicemgmt. 

Unix/Linux

To build this example, build Berkeley DB, then in the build_unix directory 
execute the command "make ex_servicemgmt".

To run the example, execute script file RunServicemgmtExample.sh in 
examples/c/ex_servicemgmt.
