 * Billing
 *
 * This is an event filter that handles the billing of cars that pass through
 * an automated toll booth.  When a car passes through the toll booth, this
 * filter looks up the car owner's information in a Berkeley DB SQL database.
 * It subtracts the toll from the owner's funds recorded in the database, and
 * sends out an alert to the owner if his or her funds are low.
