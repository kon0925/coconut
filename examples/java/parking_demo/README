This demo program is designed to demonstrate how to develop Berkeley DB
applications in Java with three popular Java IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA,
Eclipse and JDeveloper. This demo program also illustrates the three
flavors of APIs offered by Berkeley DB: the base key-value API, the 
DPL (data persistence layer) API, and the JDBC API.

A series of tutorials on how to build and run this demo program with the
above three IDEs are available at the Learn More section of Berkeley DB's
OTN site:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/learnmore/index.html

Although this demo program is primarily designed for use with an IDE, it's
also possible to build and run this program in console. This demo program
requires JDK 7 or above and the DB's JDBC driver, so you must configure DB
with the --enable-jdbc option. To build the program, run
	
	make dbdemos.jar

To run this demo program, execute the following command under the build_unix
directory:
java -Djava.library.path=<DB install path>/lib \
-cp <DB install path>/lib/db.jar:<DB install path>/lib/sqlite.jar:dbdemos.jar \
