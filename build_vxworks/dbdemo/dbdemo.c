 * ex_access -- A basic Data Store example using B-tree indexing:
 *	Add lines of text to a database and then print them out.
 *
 *   This example demonstrates storage of text in a DB_BTREE. A B-tree index
 *   stores keys in sorted order.  A B-tree has two interesting properties:
 *   (1) any key can be retrieved with the same number of page accesses as any
 *   other key and (2) it is possible to perform range retrievals, obtaining all
 *   records from key1 to key2 in order. B-Trees are a very popular indexing
 *   mechanism for these reasons.
 *
 *   The program has an input phase which inserts records into the database and
 *   and output phase which displays the records.
 *
 *   The input phase reads lines of text from the standard input and puts them
 *   into to the database. The key of each record is the whole line; the data
 *   reverses the order of these characters.
 *
 *   The output phase the uses a cursor to iterate over all the records in the
 *   database, displaying each one.
 *   
 * Source File: ex_access.c
 * Database: access.db	- a DB_BTREE
 *
 * Options:
 *	-r	remove the database during startup; otherwise new records are
 *		added to any existing ones entered by previous executions.
 *
 *   [filename]	If specified, records will be stored in this file, rather than
 *		the default "access.db".
